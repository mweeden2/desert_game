    "You've walked now for three hours, hoping to find something on the flat horizon...Now that you see it, it's strikingly straight. _I's amazing something out here could be so straight.",
    "A short ridge appears in the sand. You step aside with a start. The rock is fairly straight, but disappears into the coming sand dune. It's like the first stair step to a large courthouse without a second.",
    "The sky is especially blue today, kind of like a baby's room's walls, but where the color and light come from much more separate places.",
    "You can't stop thinking about what happened earlier today, like an open wound that you know will heal by next week.",
    "You try to walk lightly so as not to sink into the sand. Your feet would love something more solid.",
